<P>Tools must inform their editor when they are done with an interaction by calling the editor's toolDone() method.  The Tools are created once and reused. They are initialized/deinitialized with activate()/deactivate().
<P>Tool plays the role of the State in the State pattern. It encapsulates all state specific behavior. DrawingView plays the role of the StateContext.
